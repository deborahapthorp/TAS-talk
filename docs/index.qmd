## What I study {.smaller}

-   Started out in perception (vision science - how we see things move)
-   Moved on to cognitive neuroscience (how our brains work)
-   EEG and postural sway
-   Could these provide early diagnosis for Parkinson's disease?
-   We use machine learning (AI) and statistics on the data we collect
-   We've also recently started looking at eye movements & what they can tell us about the brain
-   I also do a bit of meta-science (the science of science)
